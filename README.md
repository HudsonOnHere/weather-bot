# Weather-Bot for Telegram

A bot, written for NYC ESK8 on Telegram, designed to report on the weather conditions in New York.

# Scope

In it's current form, this program understands only two(2) commands, "/start", and "/help", respectively. Future versions will encapsulate additional functionality, automatic triggering, etc.

# How to make this your own

For obvious reasons the API keys have been ommited. You will have to add a .env file to your repo containing the keys needed. Secondly, you will have to obtain your own unique Telegram API key from @BotFather (yes, really) on Telegram. They have good documentation on that.

This program uses the OpenWeather API to obtain the weather conditions reported by weather-bot. They have great documentation on working with their API as well.
