# Weather-Bot for Telegram

A telegram bot, written for NYC ESK8, designed to report on the weather conditions in New York.

# How to make this your own

For obvious reasons the API keys have been ommited. You will have to add a .env file to your repo containing the keys needed. Secondly, you will have to obtain your own unique Telegram API key from @BotFather on Telegram. They have good documentation on that.

This program uses the National Weather Service API to obtain the weather conditions reported by WeatherBot. They have great documentation on working with their API as well.
