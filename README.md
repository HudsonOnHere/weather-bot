# How to make this your own

First, you will have to obtain your own unique Telegram API key from @BotFather on Telegram. There is good documentation on working with BotFather, but it is a fairly simple proess.

Second, once you create a bot, clone this repo. Then drop a .env file at the root containing the API key.

I've set up an EC2 instance to run this in the cloud, you may want to consider a similar option. The free tier is more than enough power to run the bot.

Alternatively, you can run this locally, just keep in mind that you must be connected to the internet for the bot to continue working properly.
